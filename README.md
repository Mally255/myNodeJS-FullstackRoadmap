# A Roadmap to becoming a Fullstack web developer

A web application made with Node.js and EJS.

This project is meant to be used as a guiding beacon to those who seek to be Fullstack web developers.

I personally use this guide as a reference and in my own web development journey.

## What This Is?

A roadmap with guidelines for becoming a better suited Fullstack
Developer. The idea stems from wanting to learn more about the many
frameworks, methodologies, and aspects that contribute to the forever
growing area that is software development. With many articles,
suggestions and posts out there that can give you detailed description
of this particular journey, this roadmap aims to add some value and help
your dev skills grow.

## What This Isn't?

**The single truth of how to become a fullstack web developer!**

All the tips and recommendations are given from a personal perspective. This perspective comes from my 4+ years experience as a software developer. From working in projects, reading up on articles, and attempting numerous tutorials found online.

I acknowledge and confirm that there are countless other ways and guides to follow. My hope is that, this project contributes to the greater web development eco-system.

## Why Do This?

The overall focus of this roadmap is for "new" or "semi-accomplished" fullstack developers who want to up their knowledge on either the ends of development. Consider this guide as a point of reference to a developers journey. 

Some things may already be known to you, while some
not. Nevertheless, in the general grand scheme of everything, there is always more to learn.
